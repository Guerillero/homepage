      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>I’m Tom Fish, a geospatial technologist and (neo)liberal.</h2>
      I spend most of my time working on GIS analysis, data visualizations, and applied research for <a href="//www.dhsprogram.com/">The DHS Program</a> (vis-à-vis <a href="//www.icf.com/">ICF</a>). I also work with the <a href="//neoliberalproject.org/">Neoliberal Project</a> as a writer, pollster, and organizer. When I am not doing the work that I am paid to do or political work, you can find me playing card games and writing Wikipedia articles.

      My work sits between those of a traditional GIS analyst, developer, and cartographer. Because of this, I don't have a particularly normal day. Some days I am producing maps for survey reports, atlases, and research reports. Other days I am validating the location of where questions were asked in one our surveys. Still other days, I am working with researchers to assess the data quality of survey data with GIS or solve research questions with disparate datasets. I thrive being the utility man on a small team with a wide variety of tasks.
      <br>
      <br>
      My research focused around connecting disparate dataset via geography. I am most interested in how gridded datasets such as rainfall, population, and elevation can be utilized by researchers with minimal error. The fruit of this research is a <a href="//spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/covariates/">standardized set of geospatial covariates</a> that are being used by researchers around the world to enhance public health, economic, and demographic research. I have also been an outside subject matter expert for a number of reports and papers to bring in specialized sets of covaraites. If you are interested in colaborating on a piece of research, please <a href="/contact/">ping me</a>. I am always interested to chat about how to best use DHS data.

      I work with an idiosyncratic and ragtag group of people known as the <a href="//neoliberalproject.org/">Neoliberal Project</a>. The project is somewhat unrelated to the classical definition of neoliberal; we self-identify as neoliberal because it is what our critics to the left called us when we first appeared on <a href="//twitter.com/ne0liberal">Twitter</a> and <a href="//www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/">Reddit</a>. We are a group of, mostly, millennials and zoomers who are interested in free markets, a robust social safety net, free trade, social justice, and pragmatic policies.
      <br>
      <br>
      I work with the project to conduct a regular straw poll of people in our orbit to figure out who their preferred candidate or candidates are for the 2020 democratic primary. I am, also, a regular contributor to <a href="//exponentsmag.org/user/tomfish/">Exponents</a> where I write about the straw poll and other political topics. From time-to-time I host in-person events and meetups for
      neoliberals/neoliberal-adjacent people in the Washington, DC area.

      I am an <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Guerillero">active volunteer</a> on Wikipedia where I serve as an <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators">administrator</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Functionaries">functionary</a>, and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Clerks">Arbitration Committee Clerk<a>. Between January 2015 and December 2016, I served a two-year term as a member of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee">Arbitration Committee</a>. Most of my contributions have been administrative, but I have also written about protesting religious brothers and sisters, (Appalachian) folk music, and Norman Rockwell paintings.

      <ul>
          <li>I enjoy traveling and have been to four continents.</li>
          <li>I like law, particularly copyright law. I have never been to law school, and nothing that I say should be seen as legal advice.</li>
          <li>I (<a href="http://www.mtgeloproject.net/index.php?lastname=fish&firstname=thomas&search=Search">poorly</a>) play Magic: the Gathering competitively, and run the <a href="//www.reddit.com/r/LavaSpike/">Burn Subreddit</a>. But, I am a fan of all sorts of other tabletop games.</li>
          <li>I sometimes write <a href="//github.com/Guerillero">open source softwear</a>.</li>
          <li>I like men's fashion and clothes. <a href="/blog/lookbooks.html">Here are some lookbooks that I like</a>; I call my style Heritage Techwear, and I am influenced by New England prep, workwear, technical outdoor clothing, and Americana. I post on <a href="//www.reddit.com/r/bigmenfashionadvice/">BigMenFashionAdvice</a>.</li>
          <li>I'm a music nerd and have been tracking what I lisen to since 2007. In the last year I have gotten into lo-fi hip hop/chillhop, but I am still an emo kid at heart.</li>
