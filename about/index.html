      I am a geospatial technologist working for <a href="//www.dhsprogram.com/">The DHS Program</a> (vis-à-vis <a href="//www.icf.com/">ICF</a>) with  more than seven years of experience
      performing analysis, creating electronic and paper maps, and writing code. My role fits between those of a traditional GIS analyst, developer, and cartographer. My favorite thing
      to do is to make maps, charts, and websites that help people understand little-known parts of the world around them.
      <br>
      <br>
      I, also, work with the <a href="https://neoliberalproject.org/">Neoliberal Project</a> as a local organizer to plan events and meet-ups in Washington, DC. The project is a dedicated to
      advancing the global open society, power of markets, social safety net, and liberalism in the United States and around the globe.
      <br>
      <br>
      From 2011-2017, I worked for the <a href="https://www.washcoll.edu/centers/ces/gis/">Washington College GIS Program</a> as both a student Junior Analyst and as a full-time GIS Analyst II.
      The majority of my work was on projects for the Maryland Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention (GOCCP) and Maryland Highway Safety Office (MHSO), but I also did work
      for nonprofits and local governments. My current career would not be possible without the unique opportunity that I received at Washington College to be, functionally, an apprentice
      in addition to my normal studies.
      <br>
      <br>
      For a while, I maintained a blog on this domain. Most all of the content was the cringy writings of a college student. A few of the posts live <a href="/blog/">here</a>, the
      rest exist in the ethereal of the internet archive. The content of my musings were my own, at the time, and do not speak for my my employer(s),
      my school(s), or any other person, body, or organizations. I'm honestly not sure if they even speak for me anymore.
