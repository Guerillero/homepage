      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>I’m Tom Fish, a Copenhagen, Denmark-based geospatial technologist.</h2>
      <p>
        I am a trailing spouse and stay-at-home dog dad. I spend most of my time working on GIS analysis and data visualizations for <i><a href="https://fish.substack.com/">FishEye</a></i>. When I am not writing, you can find me writing Wikipedia articles and playing Europa Universalis IV.

        My work sits between those of a traditional GIS analyst, developer, researcher, blogger, and cartographer. Before my move to Denmark, I worked on the <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/">The DHS Program</a> as a utility man on a small team of geospatial researchers. Currently, I am a content creator for <i><a href="https://fish.substack.com/">FishEye</a></i> and an independant consultant. If you team is in need of geospatial work, <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a>. Over the past decade, I have worked in global health, environmental science, and law enforcement.

        I volunteer with an idiosyncratic and ragtag group of people known as the <a href="//neoliberalproject.org/">Neoliberal Project</a> (part of the <a href="//www.centerfornewliberalism.org/">Center for New Liberalism</a> at <a href="//www.progressivepolicy.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a>). I was the inaugural Chair of the Steering Committee in 2021. We are a group of, mostly, millennials and zoomers who are interested in free markets, a robust social safety net, free trade, social justice, and pragmatic policies.
